<h1> Project Description: <h1>
	<h1>I used the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1 to cut out two pink colory vinly stickers to decorate my notebook. I choosed to outline a cat and the M intial for my first name. I like the way it turned out! I originally had a different idea to print out a wave sticker, but since the design has way to many details, the machine was not able to cut all of the details as precisely. I instead choosed to do a simple outline of my inital and a cat so the machine can cut it out properly.

		<h1> I used the Rolands 540i printer to create two different full color contour stickers. I decided to print out my favorite character, Tina Belcher, from the show Bob's Burger. I really liked how it turned out. Figuring out how to transfer the sticker onto the laptop was not difficult because Erin helped me out.
