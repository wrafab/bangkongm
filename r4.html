<h1>Rotation 4: Laser Cutting and Engraving and Vinyl Cutting <h1>

<h1> Project Description: <h1>
	<p> For the first project, I designed a cardboard box using both raster and vector using the MakerCase software. I choose the globe, pineapple, slice of pizza, my name in a very cool font, a camel, and a palm tree to put on the card board pieces. I used CorelDraw software for this project. The laser printed the designs lightly, but I ended up liking how it turned out.

<h1>Project Description:</h1>
	<p>For the second project, I made three different shapes using CorelDraw to make a press fit. All shapes need to be able to fit together like a puzzle piece which I found not challenging to do. I selected a rectangle, circle, and pentagon for my three shapes. I hairlined all of the so the laser machine can print them out. In the end, I liked how it turned out!

<h1> Project Description:</h1>
	<p> For my third project I decided to do the coaster project. I used the CorelDraw software once again to make this project possible. I decided to put a design of palm tree silhouettes along with several camels. Underneath, I put my name on it with a cool font. After printing the design on the coaster, the design happened to not be in the center or as big as I thought it was going to be, but I'm still happpy with the result.

<h1> Project Description:</h1>
	<p> For my last project I choosed to etch a design on an aluminum bookmark. I sketched a relatively simple design that involved my name and the year I'm graduating Reserve on to the bookmark. I really liked the way my name was engraved on the bookmark, however, I could of centered it to fit the bookmark.
