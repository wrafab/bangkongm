<h1>Rotation 1: Stamp <h1>

<h1> Project Description: <h1>
	<p> For my first project, I decided to make a stamp. Since I don't know how to make a stamp or use Fusion 360, I watched several videos which helped me understand how to use the software. Following the instructions in the video wasn't too bad, although there were some parts where I had trouble finding the specicific location of certain buttons, but other than that everthing was fine.
