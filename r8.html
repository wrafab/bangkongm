<h1>Rotation 8: Soldering and Electronics <h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1> Soldering is a process in which two or more items are joined together by melting and putting a filler metal having a lower melting point than the adjoining metal. I decided to do the sound a light and the chasers for the soldering project. The overall process was relatively easy because I already knew how to solder in the first place and find it quite relaxing even! However, the sound a light project turned out not working at all even though I followed the directions very carefully. The chasers, however, worked out perfectly and I was happy to see the lights turning on. I learned that soldering, when heated to 750 degrees, can be used for electrical connections and powering the overall circuit board. In the end, I'm happy with what turned out with the exception of the sound a light not working.

<h1> Project Description: </h1>
<h1> For our next soldering project, Mr. Gerber had us do atleast ten electric projects using the bread board by following the instructions from the manual. It was interesting to know more about little information on how a circuit works to power up an LED lightbulb or have the motor turned on.
