<h1>Rotation 8: Soldering and Electronics <h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1> Soldering is a process in which two or more items are joined together by melting and putting a filler metal having a lower melting point than the adjoining metal. I decided to do the sound a light and the chasers for the soldering project. The overall process was relatively easy because I already knew how to solder in the first place and find it quite relaxing even! However, the sound a light project turned out not working at all even though I followed the directions very carefully. The chasers, however, worked out perfectly and I was happy to see the lights turning on.
