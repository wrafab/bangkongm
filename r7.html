<h1>Rotation 7: Vacuum Forming and Lamination- Skateboards <h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
	<h1>I was very excited to start making my own skateboard! I decided to assemble my skateboard first then decorate it with stickers I printed from the machine. I had Maggie help me assemble the skateboard layer by layer, it was a very messy and sticky process, but nonetheless very fun! I then have to put my skateboard in a bag and suck all the air out, which made me very winded very easily.
