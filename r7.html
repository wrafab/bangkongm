<h1>Rotation 7: Vacuum Forming and Lamination- Skateboards <h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
	<h1>I was very excited to start making my own skateboard! I decided to assemble my skateboard first then decorate it with stickers I printed from the machine. I had Maggie help me assemble the skateboard layer by layer, it was a very messy and sticky process, but nonetheless very fun! I then have to put my skateboard in a bag and suck all the air out, which made me very winded very easily. When I took my skateboard out of the bag, I needed to smooth the edges of the skateboard as well as its curves. I then sand my skateboard down so everything was even and felt smooth. When designing my sticker, I had a very hard time figuring out what to print and how to format it on to my skateboard. In the end, I ended up with printing a sticker of a background of leaves and a panda's face to cover the entirity of my board.
