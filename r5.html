<h1>Rotation 5: 3D Printing and Scanning <h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> 	The limitations for the Makerbot Replicator 5th Gen printers: 
	The size of the object that is being printed is limited to the size of the platform on the 3D printer
	Needs to refill the printer ink carthridge
	The details on an object can not be too refined because the printing materials are not able to detect small intricate details
	
	The design rules for the Makerbot Replicatior 5th Gen printers:
	Use softwares such as Fusion360 and makerbot to design your perfered object for 3D printing

<h1> Project Description: </h1>
		<h1> For my second project, I had to combine two 3D files using the Meshmixer software. First, I had my friend scan my face, then I downloaded the pedestal template online on Thingiverse. I combined my head on the pedestal and smoothed out any features that were protruding. I transfered the overall design to Makerbot and exported it so it is ready to be 3D printed.
