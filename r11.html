<h1>Final Project <h1>

<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1>I had a very difficult time deciding what to make for my final project and due to my indicicivness, the end result was not what I hoped for, but I'm happy with it. For my final project of Digital Engineering and Fabrication class, I decided to make a dual flower pot platform. For the flower pot itself, I decided to 3D print the design. I used Fusion360 to make a geometric design as my flower pot. The overall process was not too difficult because I had past experience using the software. For the platfrom and base, I decided to use the CorelDraw software to laser print the design. Overall, it has taken me atleast five class period and additional outside hours to finally complete my project.
