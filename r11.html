<h1>Final Project <h1>

<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1>I had a very difficult time deciding what to make for my final project and due to my indicicivness, the end result was not what I hoped for, but I'm happy with it. For my final project of Digital Engineering and Fabrication class, I decided to make a dual flower pot platform. For the flower pot itself, I decided to 3D print the design. I used Fusion360 to make a geometric design as my flower pot. The overall process was not too difficult because I had past experience using the software. For the platfrom and base, I decided to use the CorelDraw software to laser print the design. I also decided to decorate my platform by printing out navy blue stickers using the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1. The sticker design is in the shape of a lotus sticker and I plan on putting the sticker on the base of the platform so my flower pot can be on top of it. Overall, it has taken me atleast five class period and additional outside hours to finally complete my project.
